    <h3>Daily Summaries</h3>
    <div id="summaries"><div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-01'><strong>Day 1</strong><br><em>2025-07-01T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Day 1! Our crew of Marc, Shira and Mieke step on board and we look around home base for our last time in 7 weeks! We're both grateful for and resentful of the sunny forecast that brings with it the northwesterlies.
We head up Discovery Channel and shortly before Seymor Narrows are visited by some White-sided Dolphins! We catch the narrows right at slack, and continue to motor against the breeze until setting sail in Kanish bay. The crew decides immediately that "we should never turn on the engine again" and enjoy tacking our way up the channel all the way until Little Bear Bay. Here, we got a taste of the large and steep waves that Johnstone Strait is known for, paired with gusts. In short order we all got quite wet. We motorsailed the 3NM to Mayne Passage then turned with the wind until it all but died north of Blind Channel. By then we were in sight of our new home, and anchored in the eastern edge of Codero Islands, with some challenges due to current.
Edmond whips up dinner while the now haggard crew recovers with snacks from their first experience akin to being bounced vigorously in a jar. The views are beautiful. Marc tops off the day with dessert of Suterphreni, games ensue then sweet sleep.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>36.33 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.52 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.12 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-02'><strong>Day 2</strong><br><em>2025-07-02T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Today began with Edmond's crumpets and ended with team cookies. We slipped through Greene Point Rapids easily and motored onwards to Whirlpool Rapids against building wind in Chancellor Channel. In Whirlpool we had 3knots of current with us, and did not see any whirlpools to our relief. A short day moving on the water in all, anchoring in Forward Harbour just past the rapids.
We walked path to Besseborough Bay and were distracted frequently by sweet salmon berries. After exploring the beach we rowed back to the mothership and enjoyed a Sharc-cooked meal. This was followed by a most excellent performance of The Brown Shoes play!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>14.05 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.17 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>8.69 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-03'><strong>Day 3</strong><br><em>2025-07-03T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Break of day start to get ahead of the westerlies in Johnstone Strait. The breeze had us chilled, but we warmed up temporarily in an attempt to sail east of York Island. It was not fruitful, and we made about 1NM in an hour- but had fun! We motor-sailed the remainder of the strait until turning in towards Port Harvey. We had short-lived downwind sailing before anchoring snugly behind Range Isl.
The sunny afternoon was relaxed and loungeful besides a land excursion to collect sea asparagus and experience the delights of stinging nettle blisters.
Birthday-girl Shira cooked up a delicious dinner, and we celebrated her greatness with carrot cake and Bailey's hot-chocolate! Very nice of her to have a birthday on board!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>31.19 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.48 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.17 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-04'><strong>Day 4</strong><br><em>2025-07-04T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In no hurry we depart from Port Harvey after breakfast and enjoy a short-lived sail skirting the sourtheast edge of East Cracroft Isl. The sqeeze through Chatham Channel is uneventful and scenic, and as soon as we enter Knight Inlet we have a fabulous broad reach sail right to the mouth of Sargeaunt Passage. Big granite mountains flank each side of the passage, and we could hear birdsong through the trees. Our eager crew demanded we set sail again as soon as we exited the passage, and we had variable points of sail and speeds until the wind became fickle north of Brown Point.
We anchored in the very west corner of Wahkana Bay with a stern tie, and most crew stayed cozy down below to avoid the black flies that discovered us, while Marc took a stab at jigging.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>33.13 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.42 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.31 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-05'><strong>Day 5</strong><br><em>2025-07-05T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Post pancakes we explore Wahkana creek in search of a trail to the possible small lake. The trail started out promising and quickly ended in a thicket of salmon berries, which was delicious but inhibiting. We dash our hopes for a lake swim and instead settle for awkward bathing in the creek.
After weighing anchor we set west, stopping by beautiful Watson Cove and admiring the steep granite cliffs and waterslides. Exiting Tribune Channel we raise the Genoa in light winds and try our hand at trolling for salmon. Having no success at that, we zip over to Broughton Isl and try jigging for rockfish. We catch four small fish before Marc finally catches a suitably sized rockfish that he smashes.
We anchor in Laura cove, and Mieke cooks up delicious coconut fish curry soup while Edmond and Robin enjoy snacks on the adjacent island for boat date Friday.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>17.46 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.47 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.65 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-06'><strong>Day 6</strong><br><em>2025-07-06T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We're greeted with a beautiful sunny day- perhaps the sunniest day we've ever had in the Broughtons. Edmond graces us with fresh bread then the crew heads out for a long snorkel while Robin makes banana bread. "So much stuff" says Marc at the end of the excursion.
We do some serious sun lounging, and raise our crab trap. No crabs were up to snuff, so they lived another day.
Eventually we head out down Raleigh Passage and try some trolling under sail around Ragged Isl. No luck after a few hours, but we did see some humpbacks and enjoyed the marvellous views of mountains and rugged islands in every direction.
We continue west and anchor in Ladyboot Cove off Eden Island. After a delicious dinner we do a team paddle about the nearby lagoon and then open our exciting surprise goodies Kathy stowed away for us for Leg 1! A magical day in all.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>11.08 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.04 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.58 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-07'><strong>Day 7</strong><br><em>2025-07-07T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>A casual start to the day, the crew eventually sets off to jig just outside the anchorage. Marc catches what might have been a baby lingcod, and Robin catches some mysterious rockfish that we bonk and eat for lunch!
We leave Ladyboot cove in the afternoon heading west through Fife Sound, and try some trolling at its entrance. We do not catch any salmon, but we see a consolidatory  congested humpback and many sea lions. Cruising through the archipelago is stunning. We anchor in Sunday Harbour given the calm winds and seas, and many crew set forth and paddle about.
We enjoy a tasty dinner and play guitar/ sing songs.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>8.69 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.92 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.93 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-08'><strong>Day 8</strong><br><em>2025-07-08T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>An early and foggy morning, we pull up the crab trap- de nada! After exiting Sunday Harbour we set a straight course for our destination across Queen Charlotte Strait. The fog is thick and the rain constant. Thankfully we have a steady stream of tea emerge from down below. We see many harbour porpoises (fairly confident in the ID) dipping all around, and also see rafts of sea otters! Once we anchor in Patrician Cove we are quite ready to be dry and cozy. Mieke serves up timely clam chowder and we all drift into unplanned naps (except Edmond who is diligently working).
In the afternoon the sun peeks through some lighter clouds and the rain abates. We pile into the dinghy and set the crab trap when we spot two humpbacks. They come up with speed, mouth-first periodically, possibly spy hopping? We watch for a long while before rowing ashore and going for an evening hike on a fairly nice trail.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>28.34 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.27 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.51 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-09'><strong>Day 9</strong><br><em>2025-07-09T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We bid farewell to a distant humpback, harbour porpoise and some sea otters as we motor towards Hardy Bay. It is a beautiful morning and it doesn't take long to dock at the Seagate pier in Hardy. The rest of the day unfolds in quick succession- boat cleanup, packing, car swap (Kim and Geoff arrive!), drive to Campbell River, farewells, appointments and a shuttle back north. Leg 1 concludes, and Leg 2 commences!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>5.95 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.83 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.19 knots</div>

We're both grateful for and resentful of the sunny forecast that brings with it the northwesterlies.\nWe head up Discovery Channel and shortly before Seymor Narrows are visited by some White-sided Dolphins! We catch the narrows right at slack, and continue to motor against the breeze until setting sail in Kanish bay. The crew decides immediately that \"we should never turn on the engine again\" and enjoy tacking our way up the channel all the way until Little Bear Bay. Here, we got a taste of the large and steep waves that Johnstone Strait is known for, paired with gusts. In short order we all got quite wet. We motorsailed the 3NM to Mayne Passage then turned with the wind until it all but died north of Blind Channel. By then we were in sight of our new home, and anchored in the eastern edge of Codero Islands, with some challenges due to current.\nEdmond whips up dinner while the now haggard crew recovers with snacks from their first experience akin to being bounced vigorously in a jar. The views are beautiful.

In Whirlpool we had 3knots of current with us, and did not see any whirlpools to our relief. A short day moving on the water in all, anchoring in Forward Harbour just past the rapids.\nWe walked path to Besseborough Bay and were distracted frequently by sweet salmon berries. After exploring the beach we rowed back to the mothership and enjoyed a Sharc-cooked meal.

We motor-sailed the remainder of the strait until turning in towards Port Harvey. We had short-lived downwind sailing before anchoring snugly behind Range Isl.\nThe sunny afternoon was relaxed and loungeful besides a land excursion to collect sea asparagus and experience the delights of stinging nettle blisters.\nBirthday-girl Shira cooked up a delicious dinner, and we celebrated her greatness with carrot cake and Bailey's hot-chocolate!

Big granite mountains flank each side of the passage, and we could hear birdsong through the trees. Our eager crew demanded we set sail again as soon as we exited the passage, and we had variable points of sail and speeds until the wind became fickle north of Brown Point.\nWe anchored in the very west corner of Wahkana Bay with a stern tie, and most crew stayed cozy down below to avoid the black flies that discovered us, while Marc took a stab at jigging.", "date": "2025-07-04T21:00:00-07:00", "distance": 33.13, "avg_speed": 4.42, "max_speed": 6.31}, {"title": "Day 5", "text": "Post pancakes we explore Wahkana creek in search of a trail to the possible small lake. The trail started out promising and quickly ended in a thicket of salmon berries, which was delicious but inhibiting. We dash our hopes for a lake swim and instead settle for awkward bathing in the creek.\nAfter weighing anchor we set west, stopping by beautiful Watson Cove and admiring the steep granite cliffs and waterslides. Exiting Tribune Channel we raise the Genoa in light winds and try our hand at trolling for salmon. Having no success at that, we zip over to Broughton Isl and try jigging for rockfish.

No crabs were up to snuff, so they lived another day.\nEventually we head out down Raleigh Passage and try some trolling under sail around Ragged Isl. No luck after a few hours, but we did see some humpbacks and enjoyed the marvellous views of mountains and rugged islands in every direction.\nWe continue west and anchor in Ladyboot Cove off Eden Island.

Once we anchor in Patrician Cove we are quite ready to be dry and cozy. Mieke serves up timely clam chowder and we all drift into unplanned naps (except Edmond who is diligently working).\nIn the afternoon the sun peeks through some lighter clouds and the rain abates.
