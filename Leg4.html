After this our crew change occurs- we merrily welcome Emma and Megan on board, while sadly abandoning Dave to fare in the normal world. A goodbye to a most excellent crew member!
Shortly after heading down the mountain flanked inlet we spot humungous rafts of sea otters! 30-60 per raft depending on which crew you ask. We come to anchor in Bodega Cove, and the sun meets us there. We spend much time lounging and reading until we are sun-baked enough for a swim. After dinner we enjoy a paddle around the estuary and spot many starfish, kingfishers, herons and ginormous schools of small fish.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>13.29 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.85 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.78 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-28'><strong>Ancient places- Day 28</strong><br><em>2025-07-28T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>A very special day. We have a short motor to Friendly Cove, an inhabited land for 4300+ years by the Mowachat peoples, the most visited port by European traders north of California during the 1700 and 1800s at the height of the fur trade. Also an anchorage of Captain Cook, the site of the Spanish verses English quarrel over Canada, and the bloodied waters of the massacred crew of The Boston (read White Slaves of Maquinna). Present day it is possibly the most scenic and beautiful of coves with crystal clear bright water, views of the ocean in all directions but NW, large cliffs and jagged rocks, pebble beaches and old growth forest.
We call ahead to ask permission to come to land, and are warmly welcomed by some of the full time residents of Yuquot. We start at the beautiful cedar carving shed of master carver Sandford Williams. He seems to enjoy sharing stories of his work with us and exhibiting the beautiful totem pole he is currently forming. He fields our questions for quite some time, and it feels special to have a chance to learn from a master carver.
From there we lose ourselves for some time face down on the beach sifting through all colours of polished pebbles to collect (with permission). Next we ascend the stairs to the large lighthouse where we are greeted by Kevin the lighthouse keeper. He pulls out photos, bulbs and water filters to give us the shpeal on the lighthouse. He is patient with our questions. The most stunning thing that he's seen during his time there is the peasoup water of the herring spawn. After this we have an intermission for lunch on the boat.
Back on land with full bellies the ladies hike the start of the Nootka trail for some time. To get to the start we walk through the large gathering of Mowachat folks who are staying on the land for their summer gathering and to welcome back some stolen artifacts returned by the Smithsonian. At the same time Edmond is lucky enough to watch a humpback up close and personal rubbing on the beach!
To end this magnificent day we sail off the anchor into a broad reach straight for our new home up Bligh Inlet. Anchored, we do a lap around the boat. Megan then fills our bellies which are topped up after a dinghy row with apple crisp.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>14.85 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.04 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.52 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-29'><strong>Cougar Annie's and a tsunami- Day 29</strong><br><em>2025-07-29T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Just when we think our days can't get any better!
An early start on the warmest sunniest morning yet (blog interrupted here by tsunami advisory), we motor on the west side of hesquiat peninsula then have some building light winds that let us have a most lovely broad reach sail on the south and east side, all the way to Rae Basin. We disrupt a few jellyfish islands as we go.
In the afternoon we dinghy to Cougar Annie's, one of the most magical places on the coast, made more magical by Robin and Edmond having fallen in love here 9 years ago. Peter meets us promptly at camp Bueno, and sits us on the beach to tell us stories of Annie and of the Boat Basin Foundation. It is clear that he loves this land and has an abundance of knowledge about nature. In no hurry he tours us through his beautiful home and some of the handmade cedar cabins he has built to host visitors. They emobdy all of our dreams of homes built in a functional, whimsical and natural way. One cabin's door is build from the hollow of an ancient red cedar stump that was used by the Hesquiat to build a dugout canoe over a thousand years ago. All of them are built with cedar shakes he has hand cut from driftwood or windfall trees. At Peter's cabin, Margaret Horsfield greets us- the authour of the well known book about this exact place (unfortunately they are out of print, but her story is summarized in the booklets peter sells).
From the cabins we continue on curvy and high boardwalks to the heart of Annie's garden, nestled amongst a pete moss clearing. He shows us the sushi bar in the Japanese garden, which includes a ginormous one plank cedar table. On we go, and we are met by Devon and Brooke, the season's caretakers. They finish our tour up along yet more boardwalks that wind through the old growth forest all the way to Rae Lake. The cabins around the lake feature whimiscal lecture halls that would be perfect for some kind of educational retreat. The craftsmenship is stunning, and we snack on salal berries as we go. As we walk back through the garden we see a black bear silhouetted under the old orchard trees ambling along.
The caretakers point us in the direction of the "walk of the ancients" and we stroll through an old growth forest unlike any we have ever seen. Huge cedars in all directions, causing us to pause and generally distracting us from making headway. Both Peter and the caretakers are generous with their time and knowledge, and the entire afternoon leaves us feeling grateful and in awe.
We row back to Numenorean and do our daily dip before commencing dinner preparations. At around 22:00 we turn the internet on to check the weather and are bombarded with many messages from friends and family about the tsunami advisory for the west coast of BC after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia. Uh oh. Over dinner we discuss what we should do- the official recommendation is for boats to head into water >180ft deep. It was too late for us to do this, as the tsunami was meant to arrive by 23:30 and it would take us 5hours to get to deeper water. Eventually we settle on moving into the middle of Hesquiat Harbour which would give us more reaction time if there was a wave or current to be concerned about. We weigh anchor under a dark sky reflecting the milky way on the water, and re-anchor in the harbour. Come 23:30 and none of us are sure if we felt the tsunami. We learn the next day that the sea rose 27cm in Winter Harbour to our north and about the same in Tofino. It felt good to make a conservative decision and feel as prepared as we could.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>32.68 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.55 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.43 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-30'><strong>Beach and lake day- Day 30</strong><br><em>2025-07-30T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>After eating hashbrown casserole we weigh anchor and head back to Rae Basin to escape the mild swell and afternoon winds. The ladies head to the beach while Edmond works and stroll, read, chat, nap and dip. We see large bear tracks in the clam speckled sand.
Later we dinghy by the boat and pick up Edmond, continuing to the cabin Peter built for the Hesquait nation by the creek. He told us to push open the secret door and take a look around, which we did. The secret door was a giant and inconspicuous cedar shake, and the first room felt like a mini long house, the inner room a bright and cozy cabin. From there we take a trail to Hesquiat lake and enjoy a fresh water swim!
Back on the Numenorean Robin whips up a stroganoff and then Devon and Brooke kayak over to share dinner with us. They give us a fragrant cedar shake, and it's nice to have company. Edmond concludes the day with making some of the best diablo cookies yet!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>0.98 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>1.13 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>4.88 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-31'><strong>Hot springs- Day 31</strong><br><em>2025-07-31T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The morning entails fresh banana bread, lounging, stretching and swimming. Edmond takes his lunch break on the beach and we pick him up as we go by on our way out of Hesquiat Harbour. Almost immediately we set the mizzen and genoa and enjoy a sunny sail with the winds behind us all the way to hot springs cove.
Post dinner we leave the boat as the sun is low in the sky. We walk along the wonderful boardwalk that weaves through old growth cedars as the golden hour sunshine shoots through the trees. Finally we arrive at the hot springs! A 50 degrees celcius waterfall and pools nestled in the rocks, we are absolutely spoiled. We watch the sunset fade away as we sit halfway between the ocean waves and the hot water to reach an equilibrium. We are so fortunate to get to enjoy this special place!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>16.28 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.52 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.47 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-01'><strong>Double springs- Day 32</strong><br><em>2025-08-01T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>With difficulty, the boat awakes before 6am and heads for the hotsprings before the crowds of tourists descend. Our sleep sacrifice is worth it, and we get to enjoy the hot water amidst the fog for two hours alone. It feels like the peak of luxury.
After a hastened breakfast we head north around Flores Island to Ahousat, sailing half of the way. Once tucked in Matilda Inlet we row ashore and hike the trail through the forest and bog to the softest white sand beach.
Back on the inlet side of the hike there is a man-made rectangular pool that catches the "warm springs". It is draped with ferns and feels like an infinity pool with a view of the anchorage. It is perfectly refreshing after the hike.
Back on the boat the hungry crew scarfs down dinner despite eating all day long, and we open the surprise gifts from Kathy!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>18.52 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.53 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.04 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-02'><strong>Bunny Graves- Day 33</strong><br><em>2025-08-02T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>It's a blue pancake day, and the morning is slow going. In the afternoon we make our way to Adventure Cove on Meare's Island, sailing a while and then weaving through the ridiculous amount of crab traps in Lemmens Inlet.
Anchored, most crew swim thrice around the boat. After while Wooly cooks a delicious dinner the rest of the crew goes to shore in search of a historic site (Fort Defiance) where a fort from the 1700's stood. Instead we unexpectedly find a bunny graveyard.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>17.59 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.16 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.21 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-03'><strong>Trees... swell... party- Day 34</strong><br><em>2025-08-03T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In the morning we move down the inlet to facilitate a fantastic loop hike through an absurd number of old growth trees. Hike complete, off we go past Tofino and all of the nice sandy beaches to Uculet. Megan climbs the foremast for a better view of the misty islands.
We anchor in Stuart Inlet, a surprisingly remote feeling anchorage for being right near town. We do some laps around the boat, play boardgames and gorge ourselves on Emma's bean burgers. This is followed by a unique rendition of the Brown Shoes, mugup songs, oat fudge bars & film fest!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>29.91 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.87 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.26 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-04'><strong>Swaparoo- Day 35</strong><br><em>2025-08-04T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>A changeover day- we head to the Small Craft Harbour marina in Ucluelet where Edmond expertly snugs Númenórean between two boats. Then we commence our end of trip clean with enthusiasm and efficiency. We say a sad goodbye to Emma and Megan who will be missed, and welcome on board the one and only Saidy!
The afternoon consists of more chores, Robin cutting her thumb, a swim at the public pool and<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>1.94 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>2.98 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.25 knots</div>

We have a short motor to Friendly Cove, an inhabited land for 4300+ years by the Mowachat peoples, the most visited port by European traders north of California during the 1700 and 1800s at the height of the fur trade. Also an anchorage of Captain Cook, the site of the Spanish verses English quarrel over Canada, and the bloodied waters of the massacred crew of The Boston (read White Slaves of Maquinna). Present day it is possibly the most scenic and beautiful of coves with crystal clear bright water, views of the ocean in all directions but NW, large cliffs and jagged rocks, pebble beaches and old growth forest.\nWe call ahead to ask permission to come to land, and are warmly welcomed by some of the full time residents of Yuquot. We start at the beautiful cedar carving shed of master carver Sandford Williams. He seems to enjoy sharing stories of his work with us and exhibiting the beautiful totem pole he is currently forming. He fields our questions for quite some time, and it feels special to have a chance to learn from a master carver.\nFrom there we lose ourselves for some time face down on the beach sifting through all colours of polished pebbles to collect (with permission). Next we ascend the stairs to the large lighthouse where we are greeted by Kevin the lighthouse keeper. He pulls out photos, bulbs and water filters to give us the shpeal on the lighthouse. He is patient with our questions. The most stunning thing that he's seen during his time there is the peasoup water of the herring spawn. After this we have an intermission for lunch on the boat.\nBack on land with full bellies the ladies hike the start of the Nootka trail for some time. To get to the start we walk through the large gathering of Mowachat folks who are staying on the land for their summer gathering and to welcome back some stolen artifacts returned by the Smithsonian. At the same time Edmond is lucky enough to watch a humpback up close and personal rubbing on the beach!\nTo end this magnificent day we sail off the anchor into a broad reach straight for our new home up Bligh Inlet.

We disrupt a few jellyfish islands as we go.\nIn the afternoon we dinghy to Cougar Annie's, one of the most magical places on the coast, made more magical by Robin and Edmond having fallen in love here 9 years ago. Peter meets us promptly at camp Bueno, and sits us on the beach to tell us stories of Annie and of the Boat Basin Foundation. It is clear that he loves this land and has an abundance of knowledge about nature. In no hurry he tours us through his beautiful home and some of the handmade cedar cabins he has built to host visitors. They emobdy all of our dreams of homes built in a functional, whimsical and natural way. One cabin's door is build from the hollow of an ancient red cedar stump that was used by the Hesquiat to build a dugout canoe over a thousand years ago. All of them are built with cedar shakes he has hand cut from driftwood or windfall trees. At Peter's cabin, Margaret Horsfield greets us- the authour of the well known book about this exact place (unfortunately they are out of print, but her story is summarized in the booklets peter sells).\nFrom the cabins we continue on curvy and high boardwalks to the heart of Annie's garden, nestled amongst a pete moss clearing. He shows us the sushi bar in the Japanese garden, which includes a ginormous one plank cedar table. On we go, and we are met by Devon and Brooke, the season's caretakers. They finish our tour up along yet more boardwalks that wind through the old growth forest all the way to Rae Lake. The cabins around the lake feature whimiscal lecture halls that would be perfect for some kind of educational retreat. The craftsmenship is stunning, and we snack on salal berries as we go. As we walk back through the garden we see a black bear silhouetted under the old orchard trees ambling along.\nThe caretakers point us in the direction of the \"walk of the ancients\" and we stroll through an old growth forest unlike any we have ever seen. Huge cedars in all directions, causing us to pause and generally distracting us from making headway. Both Peter and the caretakers are generous with their time and knowledge, and the entire afternoon leaves us feeling grateful and in awe.\nWe row back to Numenorean and do our daily dip before commencing dinner preparations. At around 22:00 we turn the internet on to check the weather and are bombarded with many messages from friends and family about the tsunami advisory for the west coast of BC after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia. Uh oh. Over dinner we discuss what we should do- the official recommendation is for boats to head into water >180ft deep. It was too late for us to do this, as the tsunami was meant to arrive by 23:30 and it would take us 5hours to get to deeper water. Eventually we settle on moving into the middle of Hesquiat Harbour which would give us more reaction time if there was a wave or current to be concerned about. We weigh anchor under a dark sky reflecting the milky way on the water, and re-anchor in the harbour. Come 23:30 and none of us are sure if we felt the tsunami. We learn the next day that the sea rose 27cm in Winter Harbour to our north and about the same in Tofino. It felt good to make a conservative decision and feel as prepared as we could.", "date": "2025-07-29T21:00:00-07:00", "distance": 32.68, "avg_speed": 4.55, "max_speed": 6.43}, {"title": "Beach and lake day- Day 30", "text": "After eating hashbrown casserole we weigh anchor and head back to Rae Basin to escape the mild swell and afternoon winds.

He told us to push open the secret door and take a look around, which we did. The secret door was a giant and inconspicuous cedar shake, and the first room felt like a mini long house, the inner room a bright and cozy cabin.
