    <h3>Daily Summaries</h3>
    <div id="summaries"><div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-05'><strong>Soggy sailing- Day 36</strong><br><em>2025-08-05T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In the morning Stef and Janay arrive! A Camrose roommate reunion between the 6 of us! We efficiently stow the buckets of food they brought us then set off. Briefings out of the way, we set sail outside of Uclulet Inlet- a very soggy sail. About 15-20knots of wind on a close reach, we're all soaked off the hop. Thankfully it's a short enough journey that we relish the wind and wet until we're safely anchored in the Pinkerton Islands and take refuge down below. The afternoon unfolds in an appropriately cozy fashion with food, games and conversation.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>13.26 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.48 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.66 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-06'><strong>Bears and Whales- Day 37</strong><br><em>2025-08-06T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The day starts slowly with a hearty breakfast. The world is shrouded in misty rain clouds, but it's warm out. Robin has a lovely morning swim, and then the crew takes the dinghy out in search of bears. Within minutes we are rewarded with seeing two ambling big black bears on the shore, one of whom we see island hop by swimming. The bear shakes off, then snacks on the shoreside salal on its hind legs. Once the bear sneaks away into the forest we loop back to the boat arriving soaking wet.
Post lunch we weigh anchor and aim for nearby Nettle Island where we slow down and drop a line to fish. Within an hour we hook a beautiful chinook! It puts up a fight and we are so close to scooping it up in the net before it manages to break the line and escape! This pumps us up with enough adrenaline to continue fishing for another hour. We do not catch any more suitably sized fish but we do get magnificent views of a humpback who loiters around the fishing boats doing fishing of its own. Every few minutes it bursts out of the water with its huge jaws wide open before they snap shut and she sinks below the surface. The sun is low in the sky and the dark clouds and mountains to the east make a spectacular back drop.
From Reeks island we head southwest and decide to try sailing the short distance to Turtle Island. We learn that a mizzen-genoa combination close hauled is a poor choice, and miss many stays tacking. We make very little forward progress but enjoy the speedy sunset sailing. Eventually we tuck in around Turtle Island and anchor in time to swim under a pink sky.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>15.47 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.44 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.51 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-07'><strong>Warm and salty sea-Day 38</strong><br><em>2025-08-07T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>It's a hot and sunny morning. There is reading and stretching on deck before Wooly serves sourdough flapjacks. After this treat the non-working crew rows the dinghy around walsh island, stopping to meander on a midden.
Back on the boat Saidy whips up a PB soba noodle lunch and then we weigh anchor. In Peacock Channel we set sail and enjoy a speedy sail for about 20 minutes before the wind decides it has better places to be. No matter, we toss out a fishing line and lazily fish nearby Snowden island for an hour with no luck. To refill our luck we head to the anchorage nearest Lucky Creek and enjoy a very warm salt water swim off the boat in the sunset! We see a bear walking about on shore as we're drying off. We conclude the day with a late dinner and games.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>9.64 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.49 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.99 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-08'><strong>Luck replenished! Day 39</strong><br><em>2025-08-08T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We have a hearty potato breakfast then continue making picnic lunch and zucchini bread until we set off to paddle up Lucky Creek. Our timing is perfect for both the rising tide and sunshine, and the creek terminates at a cliff decorated with two beautiful waterfalls. We tie up and scramble up the cliffside and are rewarded with fresh water pools under a series of waterfalls in the little valley. We rejoice at our good fortune to be in such a lovely place, notably a place Cayla and Edmond went on their first SALTs trip together in 2012. We have it all to ourselves through the afternoon and enjoy swimming, frolicking, picnic lunch, reading and sun lounging all day.
It takes us a while to remove ourselves from this sliver of paradise, and we paddle back to the boat where we enjoy dinner, games and a trifle dessert.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>0.0 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>0.00 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>0.00 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-09'><strong>Easy blue sky day- Day 40</strong><br><em>2025-08-09T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>This is a serious blue sky day. We have a lazy morning with warm water swimming and a fresh bread brunch.
After lunch we gander towards Nettle Island to try our luck once more fishing- we catch a few small salmon, but nothing to keep. Alas, we redirect our energy to setting sail and beating up Imperial Eagle Channel.
Eventually we anchor off Effingham Island. In the evening we spend time watching the deep red sunset after dinner & dessert.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>20.98 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.59 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.97 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-10'><strong>Bamfield beaches & boardwalks- Day 41</strong><br><em>2025-08-10T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Most of the crew awakes early and does a short hike through a beautiful forest to the east side of Effingham. Here we find a sand and rock beach dotted with tidepools and hundreds of abalone shells. We head south on the beach to find supposed sea caves, and are distracted by all of the shore life, beach decor and wolf prints before we find a large cave. The entrance is draped with all kinds of ferns, and looking back towards the ocean and mountains is quite the view.
Once all crew are back on the Numenorean we bid Effingham farewell and motor on glassy seas to the abundantly charming town of Bamfield. After lunch we walk along the historic boardwalk adorned with mushroom art, flower boxes and gardens. The treasure at its end is icecream cones from the general store.
After exploring the west side of town we head to Brady Beach. There are picturesque rocks and sand, and it is a relief to swim in the ocean after such a hot day of exploring. We also notice a small dead Chimaera washed up we initially mistook for a shark.
After our beach excursion we go to Flora's restaurant and treat ourselves to some fine food.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>9.79 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.04 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.18 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-11'><strong>Boat surfing and beach aquarium- Day 42</strong><br><em>2025-08-11T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The day begins with the anticipation of a long day of bobbing in the swell. We prepare the best we can and then exit Bamfield bound for Port Renfrew. We are grateful that it's a sunny day and we are not plagued by the forecasted fog. The swell height on a nearby buoy is 10+ft crest to trough, and it certainly feels big as we watch the horizon disappear while Numenorean surfs down the waves. The crew copes surprisingly well, and a few hours in things seem to happen all at once- within a minute of Edmond dropping a line down to fish we catch a big Coho on the line. At the same time a humpback breaches off our starboard. There's a flurry of activity, and the time passes while the salmon is filleted and Saidy whips up lunch.
Hours go by and we take turns at the wheel. When we arrive in Port Renfrew the heat hits us all at once. We anchor off Wood's Nose and immediately jump into the pool for a swim.
For dinner we enjoy the salmon with potatoes and wild rice, and then abandon ship to catch the sunset at Botanical Beach. It's a 2.5km hike from the shore. We arrive to a beach that would fulfill the dreams of geologists, aquarium enthusiasts and sunset lovers alike. It's low tide, and we wander west while looking into the perfect glassy deep tidepools. Around the cliffy corner is a magnificent deep orange sunset. After enjoying the beach in the last of the sunlight we make our way back to the boat in the dark, decorating ourselves with glowsticks.
Paddling in the dark we marvel at the sparkle of phosphorescence beneath us as fish dart around and the paddles that carve a silvery path in the water.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>44.64 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.25 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.24 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-12'><strong>Coho and whale attention- Day 43</strong><br><em>2025-08-12T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Númenórean sets off fairly early with an uneventful morning of motoring southeast. Come noon the crew is feeling fried so we set ourselves adrift and swim in the big blue sea. As we're swimming we notice humpback blows in the distance- a foretelling of our afternoon show!
Right after swimming we notice a breeze on its way. Edmond sets the Genniker and we sail the rest of the afternoon!
A short ways into our delightful sail we have humpbacks surface in all directions around us, entertaining us for the better part of an hour. One large humpback comes for a closer look at the gawking humans and we can see him through the crystal clear water each time he ducks under the surface. The sound of dozens of humpbacks breathing and calling is disorienting.
Amidst the excitement of whales, we get a promising bite on our line that's been out all day- and Robin reels in a beautiful Coho! Just after she's finished cleaning it and the deck, we get another bite. Saidy reels in an even bigger Coho!
As we approach Sooke Harbour the boat is full of people doing all kinds of different things- guitar playing, sail dousing, salmon cleaning, steering, deck tidying...
In Sooke Harbour we are greeted with the sight of Kathy and Rob on Aeolian! We raft up together and commence the food dance- snacking, cooking, BBQ, baking... the efforts of which yield a ginormous and tasty dinner late in the night.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>38.14 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.05 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.96 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-13'><strong>Best gale sail- Day 44</strong><br><em>2025-08-13T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>It's a pancake morning with jacks flapping on both boats. The wind steadily picks up and makes the skippers anxious to go. We detach from Aeolian and make our way out of the maze that is Sooke Harbour, and are quick to set a reefed mizzen and genoa off the hop. We are quickly zipping down the wind waves and swell on a broad reach next to Aeolian in 20-29knot winds. The current is against us until we make it past Race Rocks. It is sunny and exciting as our speed climbs with the ever flattening seas and cooperative currents, making up to 10knots over ground!
Before we know it Leg 5 is coming to a conclusion as we dock at the RVYC visitor slip (thanks to Rob and Kathy). We do a panicked tidy and bid farewell to half of our loyal crew (Stef & Janay). Cayla and Saidy depart on a mission to car retrieve, while Robin & Edmond enjoy dinner at Rob & Kathy's.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>28.28 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.44 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>9.54 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-14'><strong>Layover- Day 45</strong><br><em>2025-08-14T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Our first double night at a dock! We spend the day completing chores, made much easier with Rob & Kathy's generosity lending us a car and assisting with laundry. We stow and overall feel both exhausted and replenished, relieved to have a layover day.
In the evening we enjoy dinner out at the RVYC pub with family!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>0.0 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>0.00 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>0.00 knots</div>

The bear shakes off, then snacks on the shoreside salal on its hind legs. Once the bear sneaks away into the forest we loop back to the boat arriving soaking wet.\nPost lunch we weigh anchor and aim for nearby Nettle Island where we slow down and drop a line to fish. Within an hour we hook a beautiful chinook! It puts up a fight and we are so close to scooping it up in the net before it manages to break the line and escape! This pumps us up with enough adrenaline to continue fishing for another hour. We do not catch any more suitably sized fish but we do get magnificent views of a humpback who loiters around the fishing boats doing fishing of its own. Every few minutes it bursts out of the water with its huge jaws wide open before they snap shut and she sinks below the surface. The sun is low in the sky and the dark clouds and mountains to the east make a spectacular back drop.\nFrom Reeks island we head southwest and decide to try sailing the short distance to Turtle Island.

No matter, we toss out a fishing line and lazily fish nearby Snowden island for an hour with no luck.
