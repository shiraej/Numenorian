    <div id="summaries"><div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-10'><strong>Day 10</strong><br><em>2025-07-10T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In Port Hardy the new crew- Kim, Geoff and the usual skippers top up on diesel, water, propane and especially food (Kim may have bought enough food for three legs). We head northwards in sunshine and pass by many sea otters that wish us well on our travels. There's not a breath of wind, but we enjoy the views of distant mountains and nearby islands under power.
After having no luck fishing off Castle Point we tuck in between Deserter Island and Wishart Island through a squeeze and opposing current that is very reminiscent of travelling up a river. We manage to set our anchor in possibly the only deep enough spot, and enjoy lunch made by Kim followed by naps and rest (except for Edmond who is working).
In the evening Geoff, Robin & Edmond dinghy up the narrow channel and discover a shipwreck- a large (~30ft) wooden motorboat on its side high and dry. We also find a cabin that is set back behind a midden and clearing (likely an old village site), but we could not overcome the thimble berries to approach it. The surrounding beach was littered with a surprising amount of seaglass and pottery shards. The crows calling out during our whole excursion gave the place an eerie and mysterious feel. We spot a baby seal, kingfishers and sea otters on our way back to the Númenórean.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>12.59 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.37 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.04 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-11'><strong>Day 11</strong><br><em>2025-07-11T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We have a very early start to escape our snug anchorage before the tide was too low. Shortly after getting into Gordon Channel we set the Genoa and ride with the current, going between 6-8knots in light southeast winds. Robin solo sails all the way until Bates Passage, weaving between two cruise ships. Multiple humpbacks make appearances to say hello, but none stick around. We anchor in the rain in Bull Harbour and spend the rest of the day quite cozily.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>21.91 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.68 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>8.18 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-12'><strong>Day 12</strong><br><em>2025-07-12T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>After some debate the night before the skippers settle on departing during the high water slack in the afternoon- all pros to this option except that it could mean arriving in the dark with little margin for error. We go for it, which means we have a deluxe breakfast and relax, paddling and stretching. Every other boat in the harbour opts for the early morning option which felt a bit disconcerting, but we stuck with our decision.
In the afternoon the fog had lifted and we zip over Nahwitti Bar without spotting any deadly whirlpools or killer waves. Heading west across the top of Vancouver Island we race multiple humpbacks, none of whom are willing to join us around Cape Scott. This section is sunny, with about 1m swells, following current and light headwinds. Edmond is stoked to finally get a clear view of Cape Scott with its rugged reddish rocks and hiding lighthouse.
Unfortunately the wind shifts to stay on our nose once we turn southeast, and our attempt to sail is futile. We motorsail up until tucking into Sea Otter Cove just before dusk, where we cross a seafoam finish line and are welcomed by many waving sea otters.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>32.11 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.07 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.56 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-13'><strong>Day 13</strong><br><em>2025-07-13T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The day begins shrouded by thick mist. Edmond and Robin row out for a beach walk date, slowed by thick eelgrass and mudflats. They walk along the lovely forest path toward San Joseph Bay. Upon emerging from the salal they sight two large black bears very nearby. The black bears take very little time to decide they'd rather not share the beach, and one swiftly approaches the intruders. The intruders swiftly retreat in a panic, looking back now and then only to see the bear pursuing them. Oh my! Edmond picks up a stick for some backup self-defence which immediately falls apart. In record time the humans make it back to the west beach and slowly let relief set in as no bear joins them. Bearspray and knives forevermore.
Back on the boat Kim fills our bellies with potato pancakes for the price of filling the boat with thick smoke. We weigh anchor and begin our travels southeast in confused seas. We learn that Geoff is immune to seasickness, and Robin still isn't. Plenty of seaotters float by along with a long humpback. There is a faint wind that seems promising for broad-reach sailing, however we go 3knots when we attempt it. No one is interested in doubling our time in the swell, so motor-sailing it is. We finally round Kains Island and find ourselves the only boat anchored in Browning Inlet.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>27.2 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.21 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.41 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-15'><strong>Day 14</strong><br><em>2025-07-15T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>A lazy but windy morning in our anchorage- perhaps that is why we are the only boat here. Despite the 30knot gusts the Scott's decide to go on an expedition to a supposed trail that leads from the inlet to Grant Bay. Rowing against the headwind is challenging, and Robin gets blisters on both hands to show for it. The dinghy crew goes all over the lagoon in search of a trailhead. Instead of any trail they find sea blubber, eagles and a bear. They also opt for chilly bathing in the brackish river. 3 hours later Edmond arrives by paddleboard- by this time the crew is weathered, and retreats to the Numenorean. Edmond manages to find the trail but realizes the paddleboard is leaking- he makes a panicked getaway for the Numenorean for fear of sinking! Feeling defeated, spirits are lifted by Kim's delicious BBQ skewers and some rounds of crib. We also celebrate an early birthday for Geoff with a tasty wacky cake!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>14.88 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.48 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.20 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-15'><strong>Day 15</strong><br><em>2025-07-15T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The day greets us with spotless blue skies! It is decidedly the first summer day of Leg 2. We set off in the morning for Winter Harbour where we moor at the public dock. We start laundry then take a gander on the lovely long boardwalk across the town (15 full time residents). We also peruse the small museum attached to the post office describing the town's history. Edmond goes back to work, while the Scott's walk the Blodel Trail to the beach through the "old growth forest" which has one HUMUNGOUS fir tree- 8 Robin-lengths around. Back in town we get some snacks at the general store- Dad accidentally buys candied Atlantic (farmed) salmon, and walks back to the store to return it- go Dad! A lovely stopover at Winter Harbour in all.
Leaving Winter Harbour we set the genoa in style, only to have the wind quickly die. It picks up around the bend and Edmond & Geoff struggle to set our new Jenniker sail. As soon as they succeed the wind shifts ahead of us, and the dream is squashed. We manage to sail all of the way to Koprino Harbour, and have a successful Jenniker mile before anchoring in lovely East Cove. In short order the young'uns swim amongst thick moon jellies and enjoy the evening sunshine. Robin sees a pack of squid!! It's a delight to be nestled in a beautiful, calm and warm anchorage eating good food in good company.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>14.88 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.48 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.20 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-16'><strong>Day 16</strong><br><em>2025-07-16T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Another blessed sunny day! In the morning we leave our little paradise and motor to Varney Bay. We anchor in the perfect spot 10minutes before four more boats arrive in quick succession! Banana bread gets made, naps are had and work is done. In the evening we embark on a serious dinghy excursion up the Marble River at high tide. 3NM one way! We see seals swim beneath us in the clear water, babies too. The river is flanked by large tuffa-ridden cliffs and caves. We reach the biggest cave of all when our dinghy has a serious malfunction- the oar attachment detached from the pontoon. This is our signal to pause and swim before figuring out how we row home. We settle on taking turns manually holding the oar attachment to the pontoon and rowing with small, gentle strokes. It takes us 1.5hours to return to the boat, pausing at times to attempt different rowing strategies. According to Edmond, the total distance rowed was halfway to Banff from Canmore! Leg 2 takes the prize for the most overall time spent in the dinghy ever (so far).
For the rest of the evening we fill our bellies and rest.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>15.58 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.25 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.16 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-17'><strong>Day 17</strong><br><em>2025-07-17T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>It's a pancake morning for the last day with the Scott's. It's a short hop from Varney Bay to Coal Harbour, and after tying up at the public dock Robin & Geoff explore the makeshift museum while Kim & Edmond work. The museum has the largest blue whale jaw bones on display in the world, and is filled with momentoes of the town's history of mining, RCAF, whaling, logging and fishing. The afternoon becomes a blur of boat cleaning, refueling, reprovisioning and stowing. Our leg 4 crew Dave & Cayla arrive in the evening for a run and dinner. The sinks of the Numenorean have the ocean peeking up through, a sign that she is a heavy and ready boat!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>3.85 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.03 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.81 knots</div>

There's not a breath of wind, but we enjoy the views of distant mountains and nearby islands under power.\nAfter having no luck fishing off Castle Point we tuck in between Deserter Island and Wishart Island through a squeeze and opposing current that is very reminiscent of travelling up a river. We manage to set our anchor in possibly the only deep enough spot, and enjoy lunch made by Kim followed by naps and rest (except for Edmond who is working).\nIn the evening Geoff, Robin & Edmond dinghy up the narrow channel and discover a shipwreck- a large (~30ft) wooden motorboat on its side high and dry. We also find a cabin that is set back behind a midden and clearing (likely an old village site), but we could not overcome the thimble berries to approach it. The surrounding beach was littered with a surprising amount of seaglass and pottery shards. The crows calling out during our whole excursion gave the place an eerie and mysterious feel.

Every other boat in the harbour opts for the early morning option which felt a bit disconcerting, but we stuck with our decision.\nIn the afternoon the fog had lifted and we zip over Nahwitti Bar without spotting any deadly whirlpools or killer waves. Heading west across the top of Vancouver Island we race multiple humpbacks, none of whom are willing to join us around Cape Scott. This section is sunny, with about 1m swells, following current and light headwinds. Edmond is stoked to finally get a clear view of Cape Scott with its rugged reddish rocks and hiding lighthouse.\nUnfortunately the wind shifts to stay on our nose once we turn southeast, and our attempt to sail is futile.

The intruders swiftly retreat in a panic, looking back now and then only to see the bear pursuing them. Oh my! Edmond picks up a stick for some backup self-defence which immediately falls apart. In record time the humans make it back to the west beach and slowly let relief set in as no bear joins them. Bearspray and knives forevermore.\nBack on the boat Kim fills our bellies with potato pancakes for the price of filling the boat with thick smoke. We weigh anchor and begin our travels southeast in confused seas. We learn that Geoff is immune to seasickness, and Robin still isn't. Plenty of seaotters float by along with a long humpback. There is a faint wind that seems promising for broad-reach sailing, however we go 3knots when we attempt it. No one is interested in doubling our time in the swell, so motor-sailing it is.

Instead of any trail they find sea blubber, eagles and a bear. They also opt for chilly bathing in the brackish river. 3 hours later Edmond arrives by paddleboard- by this time the crew is weathered, and retreats to the Numenorean. Edmond manages to find the trail but realizes the paddleboard is leaking- he makes a panicked getaway for the Numenorean for fear of sinking!

Edmond goes back to work, while the Scott's walk the Blodel Trail to the beach through the \"old growth forest\" which has one HUMUNGOUS fir tree- 8 Robin-lengths around. Back in town we get some snacks at the general store- Dad accidentally buys candied Atlantic (farmed) salmon, and walks back to the store to return it- go Dad! A lovely stopover at Winter Harbour in all.\nLeaving Winter Harbour we set the genoa in style, only to have the wind quickly die. It picks up around the bend and Edmond & Geoff struggle to set our new Jenniker sail. As soon as they succeed the wind shifts ahead of us, and the dream is squashed. We manage to sail all of the way to Koprino Harbour, and have a successful Jenniker mile before anchoring in lovely East Cove. In short order the young'uns swim amongst thick moon jellies and enjoy the evening sunshine. Robin sees a pack of squid!!

In the morning we leave our little paradise and motor to Varney Bay. We anchor in the perfect spot 10minutes before four more boats arrive in quick succession! Banana bread gets made, naps are had and work is done. In the evening we embark on a serious dinghy excursion up the Marble River at high tide. 3NM one way! We see seals swim beneath us in the clear water, babies too. The river is flanked by large tuffa-ridden cliffs and caves. We reach the biggest cave of all when our dinghy has a serious malfunction- the oar attachment detached from the pontoon. This is our signal to pause and swim before figuring out how we row home. We settle on taking turns manually holding the oar attachment to the pontoon and rowing with small, gentle strokes. It takes us 1.5hours to return to the boat, pausing at times to attempt different rowing strategies. According to Edmond, the total distance rowed was halfway to Banff from Canmore! Leg 2 takes the prize for the most overall time spent in the dinghy ever (so far).\nFor the rest of the evening we fill our bellies and rest.", "date": "2025-07-16T21:00:00-07:00", "distance": 15.58, "avg_speed": 4.25, "max_speed": 6.16}, {"title": "Day 17", "text": "It's a pancake morning for the last day with the Scott's.

The afternoon becomes a blur of boat cleaning, refueling, reprovisioning and stowing. Our leg 4 crew Dave & Cayla arrive in the evening for a run and dinner.
