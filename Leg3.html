Leg 3 crew sets off early and we have a lovely sunny motor through the inlet, having a friendly humpback pop up right near us. We scarf down burritos just in time before emerging into the 2m swell. Cayla's burrito quickly re-emerges, as we set sail. Quickly we are zooming 7+knots on a broad reach south. We have a beautiful sail all of the way into Klaskino Inlet, masterly weaving through Steele Reefs. We blast by an unsuspecting sea otter who does a comical flinch of terror when they finally see us.
We anchor in the nook east of Anchorage Island. Edmond & Dave quickly get into diving mode and swim about, while the others dip. A scenic dinner is enjoyed, followed by a dinghy paddle to the creek east of us. We walk up the lovely creek bed while gorging ourselves on salmon berries paired with chocolate. The dinghy ride home is magically lit by the sunset. We play boardgames then call it a night.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>39.61 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>5.61 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.61 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-19'><strong>Fish at last! Day 19</strong><br><em>2025-07-19T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The morning is characterized by a dreamy and sunny broad reach sail in reasonable seas. We find an underwater pinnacle (not a binnacle pinnacle) and spend some time fishing- first drop of the lures delivers a red snapper and a nice sized lingcod! Emboldened by the immediate success, we continue to fish- Edmond catches at least 7 more rockfish, but none to a satisfactory size.
Moving on, we enter Klashkish Inlet and squeeze into the basin. We anchor and fillet fish, which we enjoy for a late lunch. Later on we embark on yet another ambitious dinghy excursion and row up the estuary. Our turnaround point is marked by a log jam and sunny stone beach. There are beautiful marshes, trees and ferns lining the way. The row back is all against the wind, but we take turns.
Back on the boat most crew opt for a cold dip, then we enjoy the rest of the cod for dinner!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>14.39 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.86 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.20 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-20'><strong>Solander Seared Salmon- Day 20</strong><br><em>2025-07-20T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Crumpets precede our exit from Klashkish. We anticipate building northwest winds, which never appear. The sea is glassy and quite calm all the day. We take advantage of this rarity for Brook's Peninsula, and loiter around rugged Solander Island where we see tufted puffins and many breaching fish. Inspired, we drop our line and in short time catch two beautiful big Coho salmon! This is followed by many humpbacks emerging from the depths all around us for about an hour- we drift and swim and read Mary Oliver, who prophesies humpbacks breaching moments before they do! Rounding the peninsula we fillet our fish then set the Genniker for a slow but pleasing sail the last few miles to Colombia Cove.
After anchoring we quickly pack our many bags with the fixings for beach fun. We take a short and scenic forest trail with many large trees to the spectacular beach west of the anchorage. We have it all to ourselves. We design a salmon smoking apparatus and balance it over the fire, while tucking potatoes in the coals. As the food cooks the crew takes turns surfing and body surfing in the 2-3ft waves and clear water. The sand is hot and it feels like we've found a tropical paradise.
After gorging ourselves on the delicious meal and marshmallows we hike back at dusk to find our dinghy quite far away across the lagoon that had been mud, and is now water. Dave volunteers to wade and retrieve the dinghy, expecting not to have water over his knees. He returns to us with his clothes soaked up to his armpits, and he rows us back to our cozy boat. We play crib and light sparklers to conclude the magical day.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>27.68 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.80 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.53 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-21'><strong>Birthday Surf and Balloons- Day 21</strong><br><em>2025-07-21T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Edmondo's birthday!!! The unbirthdayed crew awakes early and strings balloons up the mast! Edmond awakes to chai and pancakes and sunshine. No one moves about in a hurry. Most crew go for a snorkel about the cove, and before we know it lunch arrives.
The afternoon is spent at the beach where the sand is too hot to stand on- just what Edmond ordered. There is some napping, and much surfing and wave playing! After we've had our salty fill we meander up the log-jammed creek in search of a waterfall. Eventually we are forced to swim if we are to continue, and we brave the cold water and enjoy a waterfall shower.
We leave the beach just as the sun hides behind the mountain and get back to the boat where we enjoy the rest of our catch followed by Kathy's chocolate cake!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>0.0 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>0.00 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>0.00 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-22'><strong>A foggy rest- Day 22</strong><br><em>2025-07-22T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We leave Columbia Cove in the morning and motor through the calm and fog to Bunsby Islands. We drop the hook in West Nook and have a relaxed afternoon. In the evening we go for a dinghy row to the eastern anchorage, and then conclude the day with a chilly dip.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>9.31 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.38 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.73 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-23'><strong>Check in with the Checleset- Day 23</strong><br><em>2025-07-23T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We weigh anchor early amidst a thick fog and leave the Bunsby's bound for Kyuquot. There are many rocks and reefs to dodge, requiring a lookout almost the whole way. Approaching Kyuquot we have some beautiful views of mountains and islands draped in layers of fog illuminated by the eager sunshine.
We tie up to the public wharf and explore the nearby paths. One path leads to Slab Rock which is a beautiful sharp rocky outcrop with aquarium style tidepools. One tidepool is approached through a tunnel! There are many bright green sea anenomes and a bright white nudibranch. We then take the path to Java the Hut and chat with the restaurant owners.
After lunch we row the dinghy across the bay to visit Dave's friend JR who is a local. We meet his son and mom, and tell him about a weaver we read about who once lived in the Bunsby's- he quickly realizes it is his Grandma that we're referencing! He invites us to go up the road and visit her. At Lucy's place we hear some of what her life has looked like and about her weaving. She shows us some pictures of her beautiful work of hand woven cedar around jars or abalone. As we leave she generously offers us smoked salmon and salmon skins.
Before leaving Kyuquot Robin & Edmond head to the restaurant for a date and enjoy poutine & pie. Dave & Cayla explore the trail heading east.
We decide to leave Kyuquot for the night and head to Dixie Cove. The fog lifts as we go and we anchor in the secluded inner cove over turquoise water. There is a late night serenaded swim to guitar players as we make the most of the otherwise empty anchorage.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>20.99 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.62 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.48 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-24'><strong>Rugged Beach- Day 24</strong><br><em>2025-07-24T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>A marvellous day kicked off by fresh banana bread and an aquamarine swim in fairly warm water. We savour the sunshine for a while then weigh anchor and motor against the wind until we arrive at beautiful Rugged Point. Starlink has a global outage, so Edmond gets to join us for the our beach afternoon.
We take the beautiful trail with many old growth trees to the south beach where the crew splits up to run or walk. The sand has all kinds of beautiful designs in it, there are pearly mussels everywhere and the black rocks define the shore against a multicoloured sea. Reading and napping take place. The boys frolick/surf in the wind waves, Cayla dunks and Robin observes.
Back on the north beach the scenery is exquisite enough to delay dinner for photos.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>6.3 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.98 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.87 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-25'><strong>Wolves, bears and dares- Day 25</strong><br><em>2025-07-25T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>Amidst the goings of the morning the crew is interrupted by a wolf spotted on the beach! A special sighting, Dave even snapped a photo. We waited for the sun and breeze to arrive then said goodbye to Rugged Point. Unfortunately for most of the day the wind was coming from the southeast, contrary to all forecasts. We attempted some slow sailing fishing, and eventually made enough way to justify keeping the motor off after we set the Genniker.
We settle the Numenorean in Nuchatlitz, and are invited over to Krkyra for happy hour which evolves into dinner and a return to our boat after dark. Owen and Fiona generously fill our bellies and are great hosts. A large black bear is kind enough to loiter around the beach off our stern for the entire evening, adding to the spectacular backdrop of mountains, drifting clouds and rugged islands. The bravest crew top off the evening with a magical and bright phosphorescent night swim!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>22.74 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.48 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.73 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-07-26'><strong>Big city Tahsis- Day 26</strong><br><em>2025-07-26T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In the morning we had Krkyra over for delicious sourdough flapjacks and taters by Wooly. From there we set off down Esperanza Inlet. The wind is behind us and is lovely for the Genniker which we set, but quickly doused as the pully was in shambles. Instead we settle for the Genoa and sail all the way down the inlet, pausing to motor only when the wind died in the narrows before Tahsis.
In Tahsis we tie up at Westview Marina and quickly set about a deep clean of the boat, laundry and showers. Some of the crew takes a jog through the town. Once things are looking shiny and new, including the crew, we eat at the marina restaurant and listen to some live sea shanties. We are all a bit unnerved by the noise and amount of humans around us, and quite happy to come back to the cozy quiet boat.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>19.54 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.61 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.57 knots</div>

We have a beautiful sail all of the way into Klaskino Inlet, masterly weaving through Steele Reefs.

Edmond & Dave quickly get into diving mode and swim about, while the others dip. A scenic dinner is enjoyed, followed by a dinghy paddle to the creek east of us.

We anchor and fillet fish, which we enjoy for a late lunch. Later on we embark on yet another ambitious dinghy excursion and row up the estuary. Our turnaround point is marked by a log jam and sunny stone beach. There are beautiful marshes, trees and ferns lining the way.

Inspired, we drop our line and in short time catch two beautiful big Coho salmon! This is followed by many humpbacks emerging from the depths all around us for about an hour- we drift and swim and read Mary Oliver, who prophesies humpbacks breaching moments before they do! Rounding the peninsula we fillet our fish then set the Genniker for a slow but pleasing sail the last few miles to Colombia Cove.\nAfter anchoring we quickly pack our many bags with the fixings for beach fun. We take a short and scenic forest trail with many large trees to the spectacular beach west of the anchorage. We have it all to ourselves. We design a salmon smoking apparatus and balance it over the fire, while tucking potatoes in the coals. As the food cooks the crew takes turns surfing and body surfing in the 2-3ft waves and clear water. The sand is hot and it feels like we've found a tropical paradise.\nAfter gorging ourselves on the delicious meal and marshmallows we hike back at dusk to find our dinghy quite far away across the lagoon that had been mud, and is now water.

There are many bright green sea anenomes and a bright white nudibranch. We then take the path to Java the Hut and chat with the restaurant owners.\nAfter lunch we row the dinghy across the bay to visit Dave's friend JR who is a local.
