    <div id="summaries"><div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-15'><strong>Sailing surprise- Day 46</strong><br><em>2025-08-15T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In the morning the skippers wave a tearful goodbye to our steadfast and most long-lived crew- the mystical Wooly! She has been with us for three legs of our journey, and it feels unnatural to slip lines without her. To ease our sadness our new crew Daniel and Caelan arrive with our long lost crew Dave who makes a celebrity appearance!
Before noon we set off and are quickly gifted with some surprise wind! We join its cause and sail nearly all of the way to Portland Island. Daniel diligently has two fishing lines in the water and we get two promising bites but no fish make it into the boat. We see some porpoises, and are thankful that the air is warm despite the rain and greyness that makes up the skies.
At Portland Island Royal Cove is packed full of boats. It is a rude awakening to the crowds that plague the Gulf Islands. Instead of cramming in we decide to invent our own anchorage due south of Chads Island where Aeolian eventually joins us for rafting and dinner.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>23.47 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.09 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.99 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-16'><strong>Land of Arbutus and Orcas- Day 47</strong><br><em>2025-08-16T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>After a hearty breakfast the crews of Númenórean and Aeolian pile into the dinghy and embark on a hike around the East side of Portland Island.  The Gulf Islands definitely have a different feel, with the variation of wet forest and desertish seaside cliffs with big Arbutus trees wiggling their way sunward. On the north end of the island we are completely distracted by the huge amount of blackberries, and fill a bag full. There are plenty of apple, pear and plum trees in the abandoned orchard from an old Hawaiian settlement (few to none ripe).
When we make it back to the boat the wind has picked up and we quickly weigh anchor and set sail up Swanson Channel on a broad reach. Into Navy Channel the wind is fickle and we do some beating. Some Orcas appear off our stern which is a special treat!
We manage to squeeze ourselves into the busy anchorage of Winter Cove with Aeolian rafted up. Some sunny napping is had before Kathy whips up a delicious sunset meal, followed by freshly picked blackberry crumble bars!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>13.06 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.35 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.12 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-17'><strong>Making points- Day 48</strong><br><em>2025-08-17T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>In the morning most crew do a short hike to Winter Point. Daniel makes a special potato breakfast, then we head out down Navy Channel bound for Montague Harbour. We pass Minx Reef rocks plastered with happy sun-bathing seals. The wind is fickle to start with, but eventually fills in enough to set the newly fixed Gennaker.
Yet again we arrive at an anchorage chalk full of boats- many many boats, and it takes some time to get settled into a spot to anchor and raft up without worrying about swinging into our neighbours. The sweet solitude of the west coast is behind us!
Kathleen and Rowan take the ferry to Galiano and join us for the evening! We all walk the Gray Point loop on the peninsula, a scenic hike with very beautiful arbutus and bubbly rocks.
Back on the boats we swim and then our visitors take their leave to get back to Victoria. Kathy and Rob whip up a delicious burger meal, then we play games until the crew's eyelids grow heavy.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>11.77 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.52 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>5.78 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-18'><strong>Smooth sailing- Day 49</strong><br><em>2025-08-18T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>It's a relaxed morning started with sourdough crumpets, followed by a relaxed broad reach sail nearly all of the way to Pirate's Cove under Gennaker and Mizzen.
We arrive at Pirate's Cove which is more boats than water and manage to back ourselves in to raft up beside Aeolian. It felt a lot like parallel parking a heavy car with no steering wheel and slippery wheels. Surprisingly, we tie up without incident!
Rafted, most crew enjoy a walk around the marine park and return to a hot meal ready after a cold swim around the boats. We're treated by Kathy to a chocolate fondue dessert!<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>19.84 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.50 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.06 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-19'><strong>Big city excursion- Day 50</strong><br><em>2025-08-19T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>The day starts pleasantly and includes forest ganders, swimming, working and stretching. As noon draws near we weigh anchor and leave the narrow exit out of Pirate's Cove with barely any water beneath us. Once we're heading north we realize we're early for Dodd's Narrows! Oops. We reduce sail and change our tactics to how we can sail the most distance over the most time before reaching the rapids. Daniel is pleased we are going an appropriate fishing speed.
When we do reach the narrows we go through with 2-3knots tailing Aeolian, and manage to avoid the abundant traffic going both directions.
We manage to find a decent spot to anchor by Newcastle Island. Caelan and Daniel paddle to the marine park before we all hop on Aeolian who ferries us over to the big city of Nanaimo. Here we trek up the hill to Gina's, a Mexican restaurant that Edmond's family has dined at on his childhood journeys up the island. After a tasty meal we treat ourselves to gelato after an oceanside walk. We also sample Nanaimo's impressively creative playground equipment.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>12.58 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.04 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>7.63 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-20'><strong>Sheep, owls and orchards- Day 51</strong><br><em>2025-08-20T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We awake to the LAST day at anchor of our trip! Wow. Aeolian slips lines early and waves goodbye as they head southwards. It is sad to watch them go- it has been so nice for them to join us for Leg 6! We weigh anchor shortly after and head northwest, against the wind.
The military zone of Whisky Gulf is open to its east, so we decide to set all four sails close hauled to cross over to Jedediah. The wind shifts westward in our favour, and we zip through the waves without tacking once. South of Jedediah we lower sail and try fishing. Daniel catches two salmon, too small to keep but encouraging nonetheless.
We invent an anchorage on the east side of Jedidiah near Codfish cove, and then stagger our island ganders. Jedidiah is a beautiful and charming island, with wide paths and minimal undergrowth thanks to the many wooly sheep roaming free. The old homestead is in a scenic location overseeing the lovely lagoon. There is a well stocked orchard backed by sunny meadows that we hope to come back to in the Fall.
We swim off a well maintained dock in warmer cold water, savouring our last ocean dip of the trip. Daniel and Caelan spot an owl on their journey, while Robin and Edmond enjoy a picnic date on the west side.
At dusk we reconvene on the boat where Daniel and Caelan have a tasty meal ready to serve. We play some games before we all fade into pre-sleeping zombies.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>24.4 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>3.80 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.17 knots</div>
<div class='summary-card' data-date='2025-08-21'><strong>Final push- Day 52</strong><br><em>2025-08-21T21:00:00-07:00</em><br>We're up and ready to go at sunrise, and start our long motor home against the breeze. Texada Island goes on for hours, and the crew pass the time working, napping, dancing, playing guitar and fishing. I believe it's the longest single day of travel (55NM) during the whole trip. It was a good way to draw out the trip's end and reflect on the long and fun journey it's been.
Once we reach Cape Mudge we try some fishing, and catch three undersize salmon we return to the sea. Maxime swings by on Watershed to say hello, and we start to feel like we're really home.
After fuelling up and docking without issue we do a blitz clean of the boat (all time record). If only we'd known what we know now at the start of the trip. Marc and Shira come to pick up Daniel and Caelan, and it's special to have seen them on both the first and last days of our trip! We say goodbye to our crew/friends and officially conclude our circumnavigation when we walk past our old slip on our way to the showers.<br><br><strong>Distance: </strong>55.51 Miles<br><strong>Avg Speed: </strong>4.47 knots<br><strong>Max Speed: </strong>6.57 knots</div>

We see some porpoises, and are thankful that the air is warm despite the rain and greyness that makes up the skies.\nAt Portland Island Royal Cove is packed full of boats.

There are plenty of apple, pear and plum trees in the abandoned orchard from an old Hawaiian settlement (few to none ripe).\nWhen we make it back to the boat the wind has picked up and we quickly weigh anchor and set sail up Swanson Channel on a broad reach. Into Navy Channel the wind is fickle and we do some beating.

The sweet solitude of the west coast is behind us!\nKathleen and Rowan take the ferry to Galiano and join us for the evening! We all walk the Gray Point loop on the peninsula, a scenic hike with very beautiful arbutus and bubbly rocks.\nBack on the boats we swim and then our visitors take their leave to get back to Victoria. Kathy and Rob whip up a delicious burger meal, then we play games until the crew's eyelids grow heavy.", "date": "2025-08-17T21:00:00-07:00", "distance": 11.77, "avg_speed": 3.52, "max_speed": 5.78}, {"title": "Smooth sailing- Day 49", "text": "It's a relaxed morning started with sourdough crumpets, followed by a relaxed broad reach sail nearly all of the way to Pirate's Cove under Gennaker and Mizzen.\nWe arrive at Pirate's Cove which is more boats than water and manage to back ourselves in to raft up beside Aeolian. It felt a lot like parallel parking a heavy car with no steering wheel and slippery wheels. Surprisingly, we tie up without incident!\nRafted, most crew enjoy a walk around the marine park and return to a hot meal ready after a cold swim around the boats.

As noon draws near we weigh anchor and leave the narrow exit out of Pirate's Cove with barely any water beneath us. Once we're heading north we realize we're early for Dodd's Narrows! Oops. We reduce sail and change our tactics to how we can sail the most distance over the most time before reaching the rapids. Daniel is pleased we are going an appropriate fishing speed.\nWhen we do reach the narrows we go through with 2-3knots tailing Aeolian, and manage to avoid the abundant traffic going both directions.\nWe manage to find a decent spot to anchor by Newcastle Island. Caelan and Daniel paddle to the marine park before we all hop on Aeolian who ferries us over to the big city of Nanaimo. Here we trek up the hill to Gina's, a Mexican restaurant that Edmond's family has dined at on his childhood journeys up the island. After a tasty meal we treat ourselves to gelato after an oceanside walk. We also sample Nanaimo's impressively creative playground equipment.", "date": "2025-08-19T21:00:00-07:00", "distance": 12.58, "avg_speed": 4.04, "max_speed": 7.63}, {"title": "Sheep, owls and orchards- Day 51", "text": "We awake to the LAST day at anchor of our trip! Wow. Aeolian slips lines early and waves goodbye as they head southwards. It is sad to watch them go- it has been so nice for them to join us for Leg 6! We weigh anchor shortly after and head northwest, against the wind.\nThe military zone of Whisky Gulf is open to its east, so we decide to set all four sails close hauled to cross over to Jedediah. The wind shifts westward in our favour, and we zip through the waves without tacking once. South of Jedediah we lower sail and try fishing. Daniel catches two salmon, too small to keep but encouraging nonetheless.\nWe invent an anchorage on the east side of Jedidiah near Codfish cove, and then stagger our island ganders. Jedidiah is a beautiful and charming island, with wide paths and minimal undergrowth thanks to the many wooly sheep roaming free. The old homestead is in a scenic location overseeing the lovely lagoon. There is a well stocked orchard backed by sunny meadows that we hope to come back to in the Fall.\nWe swim off a well maintained dock in warmer cold water, savouring our last ocean dip of the trip. Daniel and Caelan spot an owl on their journey, while Robin and Edmond enjoy a picnic date on the west side.\nAt dusk we reconvene on the boat where Daniel and Caelan have a tasty meal ready to serve.

It was a good way to draw out the trip's end and reflect on the long and fun journey it's been.\nOnce we reach Cape Mudge we try some fishing, and catch three undersize salmon we return to the sea. Maxime swings by on Watershed to say hello, and we start to feel like we're really home.\nAfter fuelling up and docking without issue we do a blitz clean of the boat (all time record). If only we'd known what we know now at the start of the trip. Marc and Shira come to pick up Daniel and Caelan, and it's special to have seen them on both the first and last days of our trip!
